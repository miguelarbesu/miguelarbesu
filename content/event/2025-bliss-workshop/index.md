abstract: "The human genome sequence provides the underlying code for human biology. Understanding the sequence-code of the genome is vital for understanding how genetic variants affect human disease and traits, but it has remained one of the biggest challenges in biology. In an era of exponential growth of genomics and biomedical data, genomics foundation models have emerged as powerful tools to aid this goal due to their capacity to identify highly complex patterns in large datasets. Can these models that have revolutionized image recognition and natural language also help us decode the human genome and advance personalized medicine? In this workshop, we will provide an overview of how genomics foundation models can be used to learn the regulatory code of the genome, discuss specific models and applications, and get hands-on experience implementing them."
